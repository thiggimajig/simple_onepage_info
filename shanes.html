            I have been at the New York Times since January, 2019, and I have been the tech lead
            for the Oak, the Times' collaborative rich text editor, since January, 2020.

            In the past, I've been lucky enough to work on MegsRadio.fm (see

            fullstack web technologies, like Typescript, React, Redux, ProseMirror, and next.js. I
            enjoy working with product managers, UX/UI designers, and clients to make useful
            and beautiful products that solve real problems in elegant ways.
